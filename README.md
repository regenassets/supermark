## What is Supermark?

Supermark is a fully open-source, AGPL-licensed document sharing and data room platform. It's a clean-room reimplementation based on Papermark, with all commercial-licensed code removed and replaced with AGPL implementations.

**Perfect for:**
- Teams who need document sharing without subscription fees
- Organizations requiring full control over their data
- Self-hosted deployments with unlimited users and documents
- Custom integrations and modifications

## Key Features

✅ **Document Sharing** - Share PDFs, presentations, spreadsheets, and more  
✅ **Data Rooms** - Organize documents in virtual data rooms  
✅ **Analytics** - Track views, downloads, and engagement  
✅ **Team Management** - Multiple users with role-based permissions  
✅ **Custom Domains** - Use your own domain for sharing links  
✅ **Security** - Email verification, OTP, password protection, watermarks  
✅ **Storage** - MinIO S3-compatible storage included  
✅ **Unlimited Everything** - No user, document, or link limits

## What's Different from Papermark?

Supermark is **100% AGPL-licensed** with:
- ❌ No Stripe billing/payments (not needed for self-hosted)
- ❌ No commercial license restrictions
- ❌ No subscription fees
- ✅ All features unlimited
- ✅ Full source code access
- ✅ Freedom to modify and redistribute
